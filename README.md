# Amath482
> Computational Methods for Data Analysis \
> Taught by Prof. J. Nathan Kutz

This class was a project based class and each homework requires the detailed-writings of reports. \
I truly enjoyed the class and had learned a lot from the class. \
For programming part of the class, I used **MATLAB** and **Python**.
